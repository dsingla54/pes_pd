# Advanced Physical Design using OpenLANE/Sky130 

## Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)

To develop an ASIC, We mainly require 3 components
- RTL IPs (github.com, opencores.org, librecores.org)
- PDK data (Qflow, OpenRoad, OpenLane)
- EDA Tools [google+skywater](github.com/google/skywater-pdk)

1. **```RTL```** : refers to a specific abstraction level in the field of digital design and electronics, where the behavior of a system is articulated in terms of registers, logic gates, and the interconnected flow of data between these elements
2. **```PDK```** :  short for Process Design Kit, comprises a set of resources such as files, libraries, and documentation offered by semiconductor foundries. These resources are intended to aid designers in the creation of integrated circuits (ICs) that align with a particular manufacturing process. PDKs encompass crucial information concerning design regulations, device models, and technology files essential for the design and simulation of ICs.
3. **```EDA```** : or Electronic Design Automation tools, represents a category of software applications employed for the development and evaluation of electronic systems, encompassing ICs and PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards). These tools play a pivotal role in facilitating the design and testing phases of electronic systems.

## OpenLANE Design Stages

OpenLANE flow consists of several stages. By default all flow steps are run in sequence. Each stage may consist of multiple sub-stages. OpenLANE can also be run interactively as shown [here][25].

1. *Synthesis*
    1. `yosys` - Performs RTL synthesis
    2. `abc` - Performs technology mapping
    3. `OpenSTA` - Pefroms static timing analysis on the resulting netlist to generate timing reports
2. *Floorplan and PDN*
    1. `init_fp` - Defines the core area for the macro as well as the rows (used for placement) and the tracks (used for routing)
    2. `ioplacer` - Places the macro input and output ports
    3. `pdn` - Generates the power distribution network
    4. `tapcell` - Inserts welltap and decap cells in the floorplan
3. *Placement*
    1. `RePLace` - Performs global placement
    2. `Resizer` - Performs optional optimizations on the design
    3. `OpenPhySyn` - Performs timing optimizations on the design
    4. `OpenDP` - Perfroms detailed placement to legalize the globally placed components
4. *CTS*
    1. `TritonCTS` - Synthesizes the clock distribution network (the clock tree)
5. *Routing*
    1. `FastRoute` - Performs global routing to generate a guide file for the detailed router
    2. `CU-GR` - Another option for performing global routing.
    3. `TritonRoute` - Performs detailed routing
    4. `SPEF-Extractor` - Performs SPEF extraction
6. *GDSII Generation*
    1. `Magic` - Streams out the final GDSII layout file from the routed def
    2. `Klayout` - Streams out the final GDSII layout file from the routed def as a back-up
7. *Checks*
    1. `Magic` - Performs DRC Checks & Antenna Checks
    2. `Klayout` - Performs DRC Checks
    3. `Netgen` - Performs LVS Checks
    4. `CVC` - Performs Circuit Validity Checks

OpenLane can be operated at 2 different modes ie., Automated flow and Interactive mode.

## To enter the automated flow, use these commands
```
cd OpenLane
make mount
./ flow.tcl -design openlane/<DESIGN_NAME>  -tag <TAG>
```

## To enter the Interactive mode, use these commands 
```
cd OpenLane
make mount
./flow.tcl -interactive 
prep -design <path_to_your_design_folder> -tag <tag> -overwrite //overwrite is optional
```
